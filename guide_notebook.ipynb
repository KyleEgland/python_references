    "This is the index for my Python reference - welcome!  I've tried to create this to be both useful for myself and others.  I've learned a LOT from free resources - various forums, threads, articles, etc. - and want to try to give back to the community.  This repo will be a continuously changing and improving project for me (you should _never_ be done learning) so feel free to fork it, clone it, or use this information in whatever way you see fit!  Lastly, thanks for checking out my work, it means a lot.\n",
