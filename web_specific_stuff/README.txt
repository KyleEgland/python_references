# Web Specific Stuff
## README file
Directory to store (most) web related Python examples (I.e. servers, scrapers, etc.).  If what you're looking for cannot be found here, check the "data_manipulation" directory as some of the data manipulation examples may include some data collection via the web and will also incorporate sorting/collating/storing that data.
