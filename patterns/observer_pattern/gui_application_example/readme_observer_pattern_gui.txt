# Observer Pattern - GUI Demo

### Synopsis
This directory contains a Python program that uses a TKinter GUI to show the observer pattern in action between two tabs.  Both tabs have a "click" counter that shows a number (starting with 0) that can be incremented with the "+" and "-" buttons.  This number is reflected in both tabs via varserver.py; please to be enjoying!

### Motivation
I like GUIs (it makes it easier for people to use my work - command lines are scary) and sometimes information needs to be shared between tabs.  This work was created in order to provide myself a reminder of how to accomplish that.

### Installation
The only dependency is Python 3.x (should work for most versions).  If you're running on a Linux box (and maybe Mac?) you may need to install TKInter dependencies - I've done it before but my work machine is Windows and TKinter is packaged with Python installations for Windows.

### Running
Simply run "mainApplication.py"!
